Interactive lightweight webpages created using Streamlit that allows users to play around and visualize regression models and neural networks created by me.

Includes CIFAR-10 classifier powered by neural networks and Logistic Regression models applied on the Boston Housing dataset, cancer detection dataset, and iris properties dataset. Each webpage has their own interactive tools that allow user input. This includes uploading files and changing features to see how the model reacts.

User inputted sliders to edit features to see if model classifies as malignant or benign
